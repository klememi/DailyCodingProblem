Daily Coding Problem
====================

Here is my approach for simple coding challenges I bumped into at `dailycodingproblem.com <http://dailycodingproblem.com>`_. I am using **Swift** as it's my primary language however problems are of course language-independent. Feel free to create a new issue thread for your questions or suggestions.

001 `Reversed interleaving using stack and queue <https://github.com/klememi/DailyCodingProblem/blob/master/001_StackReversedInterleaving.swift>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This problem was asked by Google.*

Given a stack of ``N`` elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``, it should become ``[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]``.
If the stack is ``[1, 2, 3, 4]``, it should become ``[1, 4, 2, 3]``.
