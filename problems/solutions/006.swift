// This problem was asked by Google.
//
// An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead
// of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which
// is a XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement a XOR linked list;
// it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index)
// which returns the node at index.
