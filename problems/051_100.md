**Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.** It should be able to be initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

Sudoku is a puzzle where you're given a partially-filled 9 by 9 grid with digits. The objective is to fill the grid with the constraint that every row, column, and box (3 by 3 subgrid) must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## 057 [String break up]() - TODO
> This problem was asked by Amazon

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, **break up the string into multiple texts such that each text has a length of** `k` **or less**. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. If there's no way to break the text up, then return `null`.

*You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.*

For example, given the string `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` and `k = 10`, you should return: `["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]`. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.

## 058 [Finding element in array]() - TODO

An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.

Given such an array, **find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time**. If the element doesn't exist in the array, return `null`.

## 060[Subset of given sum]() - TODO

**Given a set of integers, return whether the set can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.**

For example, given the set `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 25, 10}`, it would return `true`, since we can split the set up into `{15, 5, 10, 15, 10}` and `{20, 35}`, which both add up to 55.

Given the set `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35}`, it would return `false`, since we can't split the set up into two subsets that add up to the same sum.

## 061[Integer exponentiation]() - TODO

**Implement integer exponentiation.** That is, implement the `pow(x, y)` function, where `x` and `y` are integers and returns x<sup>y</sup>.

## 062[]() - TODO

There is an `N` by `M` matrix of zeroes. Given `N` and `M`, **write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner.** You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return `2`, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

- Right, then down
- Down, then right

Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are `70` ways to get to the bottom-right.

## 063[Word in the matrix]() - TODO

**Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.**

    ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
    ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
    ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]

and the target word `FOAM`, you should return `true`, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word `MASS`, you should return `true`, since it's the last row.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that all squares are visited once.

## 066[]() - TODO

Implement an LFU (*Least Frequently Used*) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value)`: sets key to value. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently used key should be removed.
- `get(key)`: gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return `null`.

Each operation should run in `O(1)` time.

On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

You are given `N` bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a `M` by `M` chessboard. **Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other**. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: `(1, 2)` is considered the same as `(2, 1)`.

For example, given `M = 5` and the list of bishops:

    (0, 0)
    (1, 2)
    (2, 2)
    (4, 0)

The board would look like this:

    [b 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 b 0 0]
    [0 0 b 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [b 0 0 0 0]

You should return `2`, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.

**Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.**

For example, if the list is `[-10, -10, 5, 2]`, we should return `500`, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.

You can assume the list has at least three integers.

## 071[]() - TODO
> This problem was asked by Google

In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through `ABACA`, the value of the path is `3`, since there are 3 occurrences of `A` on the path.

**Given a graph with** `n` **nodes and** `m` **directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return** `null`**.**

The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The i-th character represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. Each tuple in the edge list (i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node. Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.

For example, the following input graph:

    ABACA
    [(0, 1),
    (0, 2),
    (2, 3),
    (3, 4)]

Would have maximum value `3` using the path of vertices [0, 2, 3, 4], (A, A, C, A).

The following input graph:

    A
    [(0, 0)]

Should return `null`, since we have an infinite loop.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is `N` by `N`. That is, a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).

**Given integers** `N` **and** `X`**, write a function that returns the number of times** `X` **appears as a value in an** `N` **by** `N` **multiplication table.**

For example, given `N = 6` and `X = 12`, you should return `4`, since the multiplication table looks like this:

    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |    
    | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
    | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |
    | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |
    | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |
    | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |

And there are 4 12's in the table.

Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.

For example, given the array `[0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]`, the longest increasing subsequence has length `6`: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.

## 075[]() - TODO
> This problem was asked by Google

You are given an `N` by `M` 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

    cba
    daf
    ghi

This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

    ca
    df
    gi

So your function should return `1`, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

    abcdef

Your function should return `0`, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

    zyx
    wvu
    tsr

Your function should return `3`, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.

It should contain the following methods:

set(key, value, time): sets key to value for t = time.
get(key, time): gets the key at t = time.
The map should work like this. If we set a key at a particular time, it will maintain that value forever or until it gets set at a later time. In other words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for that key set at the most recent time.

Consider the following examples:

d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2
d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
