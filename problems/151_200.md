You are given n numbers as well as n probabilities that sum up to 1. Write a function to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability.

For example, given the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] and probabilities [0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2], your function should return 1 10% of the time, 2 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.

You can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 uniformly.

### Solution

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

push(item), which adds an element to the stack
pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)
Recall that a heap has the following operations:

push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap

### Solution

Given a list of elements, find the majority element, which appears more than half the times (> floor(len(lst) / 2.0)).

You can assume that such element exists.

For example, given [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0], return 1.

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

Right, down, down, right
Down, right, down, right
The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.

Given a string, return the first recurring character in it, or null if there is no recurring chracter.

For example, given the string "acbbac", return "b". Given the string "abcdef", return null.

Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.

For example, given the following tree:

   a
  /|\
 b c d
    / \
   e   f
  / \
 g   h
and the weights: a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1, the longest path would be c -> a -> d -> f, with a length of 17.

The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.

Given a 32-bit integer, return the number with its bits reversed.

For example, given the binary number 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000, return 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111.

Given a list of words, return the shortest unique prefix of each word. For example, given the list:

    dog
    cat
    apple
    apricot
    fish

Return the list:

    d
    c
    app
    apr
    f

Given an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation, write a program to evaluate it.

The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. For example: [5, 3, '+'] should return 5 + 3 = 8.

For example, [15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-'] should return 5, since it is equivalent to ((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5.

You can assume the given expression is always valid.
